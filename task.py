# Below are the three functions that we'll be working on
# To get credit for our work, the functions all have to exist in the same file.
# Because of the way this assignment is set up, each pull request has to get approved by another group member.
# Rough Steps to getting approval:
# 1. create and checkout a branch of your own to work on
# 2. commit and push code to your own branch
# 3. when ready to merge to main, run testing suit before submitting a pull request to merge
# 4. Send out a message on discord to ask a group member to approve to approve your pull request.

# I'm just making this up as I go, so feel free to adjust the step above.
# Just communicate your changes if you make them so we're all on the same page
